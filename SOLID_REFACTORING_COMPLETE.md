# SOLID Principles Refactoring - Complete Summary

**Branch:** `refactor/solid-srp-dataframe`  
**Reference:** https://realpython.com/solid-principles-python/

## Overview

Comprehensive refactoring of the Mock Spark codebase to apply SOLID principles,
focusing on the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), DRY principle, and
design patterns like Template Method and Factory Method.

---

## Phase 1: Expression Evaluation & Statistics ✅

### Problem
- `MockDataFrame` was 3,669 lines with 101 methods - violated SRP
- Expression evaluation logic duplicated in 3 places:
  - `dataframe.py`: 28 `_evaluate_*` methods (~1,500 lines)
  - `conditional.py`: 5 duplicate methods (~150 lines)
  - Different implementations, same logic

### Solution
Created centralized evaluation engine and extracted statistical operations.

### Changes

**1. ExpressionEvaluator** (`mock_spark/core/expression_evaluator.py` - 725 lines)
- Single source of truth for ALL expression evaluation
- Handles conditions, comparisons, arithmetic, functions, CASE WHEN
- Used by both MockDataFrame and MockCaseWhen
- Eliminated all code duplication

**2. DataFrameStatistics** (`mock_spark/dataframe/statistics.py` - 225 lines)
- Statistical operations (`describe`, `summary`)
- Extracted from MockDataFrame
- Clear, focused responsibility

**3. MockDataFrame** (`mock_spark/dataframe/dataframe.py`)
- **Before:** 3,669 lines
- **After:** 2,880 lines
- **Reduction:** 789 lines (-21.5%)
- Added `self._evaluator` composition
- Delegates to specialized modules

**4. MockCaseWhen** (`mock_spark/functions/conditional.py`)  
- **Reduction:** 18 lines
- Removed duplicate evaluation methods
- Delegates to ExpressionEvaluator

### Results - Phase 1

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines eliminated | 789 from dataframe.py |
| Duplication removed | ~1,650 lines |
| New modules | 2 (evaluator, statistics) |
| Tests passing | 502 → 502 ✅ |
| API breaks | 0 |

---

## Phase 2: Storage Backend Unification ✅

### Problem
- `FileStorageManager` and `MemoryStorageManager` had **identical implementations**
- 17 methods duplicated between both classes
- ~333 lines of duplicate code
- Violates DRY principle

### Solution
Created `BaseStorageManager` using Template Method pattern.

### Changes

**1. BaseStorageManager** (`mock_spark/storage/backends/base.py` - 257 lines)
- Abstract base class implementing IStorageManager
- 14 shared concrete methods
- Factory method: `_create_schema_instance()` for subclass customization
- Template Method pattern for algorithm skeleton

**2. MemoryStorageManager** refactored
- **Before:** 353 lines
- **After:** 180 lines  
- **Reduction:** 173 lines (-49%)
- Inherits from BaseStorageManager
- Only implements 2 custom methods

**3. FileStorageManager** refactored
- **Before:** 411 lines
- **After:** 251 lines
- **Reduction:** 160 lines (-39%)
- Inherits from BaseStorageManager
- Only implements 2 custom methods

### Results - Phase 2

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duplication eliminated | 333 lines |
| Net reduction | 76 lines |
| Shared methods | 14 |
| Tests passing | 511 + 9 = 520 ✅ |
| API breaks | 0 |

## SOLID Principles Applied

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Before:** Classes had multiple responsibilities
- `MockDataFrame`: DataFrame ops + evaluation + statistics
- `MemoryStorageManager`: Storage + duplicated schema management
- `FileStorageManager`: Storage + duplicated schema management

**After:** Each class has one clear purpose
- `MockDataFrame`: DataFrame operations only
- `ExpressionEvaluator`: Expression evaluation only
- `DataFrameStatistics`: Statistical computations only
- `BaseStorageManager`: Storage management template
- `MemoryStorageManager`: Memory-specific storage
- `FileStorageManager`: File-specific storage

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Achieved:**
- `BaseStorageManager` is open for extension (add new backends)
- Closed for modification (shared logic doesn't change)
- New storage backends inherit 14 methods automatically

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Achieved:**
- `MemoryStorageManager` and `FileStorageManager` fully substitute `BaseStorageManager`
- All subclasses properly implement required methods
- No breaking of contracts

### ✅ DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
**Before:** Expression evaluation logic in 3 places, storage logic in 2 places
**After:** Single source of truth for each concern
- Expression evaluation: 1 place (ExpressionEvaluator)
- Storage operations: 1 place (BaseStorageManager)

---

## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. **Composition over Inheritance**
```python
class MockDataFrame:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self._evaluator = ExpressionEvaluator()  # Composition
```

### 2. **Template Method Pattern**
```python
class BaseStorageManager(ABC):
    def create_schema(self, schema: str):
        # Template method with fixed algorithm
        if schema not in self.schemas:
            self.schemas[schema] = self._create_schema_instance(schema)
    
    @abstractmethod
    def _create_schema_instance(self, name: str) -> ISchema:
        # Subclasses customize this step
        pass
```

### 3. **Factory Method Pattern**
```python
class MemoryStorageManager(BaseStorageManager):
    def _create_schema_instance(self, name: str) -> ISchema:
        return MemorySchema(name)  # Factory method

class FileStorageManager(BaseStorageManager):
    def _create_schema_instance(self, name: str) -> ISchema:
        return FileSchema(name, self.base_path)  # Factory method
```

### 4. **Strategy Pattern (Delegation)**
```python
class MockDataFrame:
    def filter(self, condition):
        # Delegates strategy to ExpressionEvaluator
        filtered = self._evaluator.apply_filter(self.data, condition)
        return MockDataFrame(filtered, self.schema, self.storage)
```

## Future Opportunities

### High Complexity - Deferred to Separate Project

**SQLAlchemyMaterializer** (2,367 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities: type mapping, operation application, SQL generation
- Tightly coupled, would require major refactoring
- Recommendation: Dedicated project phase with careful planning

### Lower Priority

**MockGroupedData** (480 lines)
- Could extract AggregationEngine
- Already reasonably organized
- Recommendation: Future iteration if needed

**MockSparkSession** (535 lines)
- Already well-structured with proper delegation
- No immediate action needed
