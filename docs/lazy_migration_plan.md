# Lazy-by-Default Transition Plan

## Overview
- Objective: Make Mock-Spark lazy by default, mirroring PySpark execution semantics, and deprecate eager execution paths.
- Outcome: All DataFrame transformations are queued; actions (collect, count, toPandas, show) materialize.

## Principles
- Equivalent semantics to PySpark for transformation chaining and action materialization
- Deterministic schema projection without materialization
- Tests that assert state must materialize via `collect()` (or `toPandas()`), same as PySpark

## Scope
- DataFrame core (filter, select, withColumn, groupBy, join, union)
- Actions (collect, count, toPandas, show)
- Session configuration and deprecation timeline
- Unit + compatibility tests, docs, migration guide

## Risks
- Hidden dependencies on eager behavior in legacy tests
- Performance regressions if operation graph grows without pruning
- Schema inference edge cases during lazy projection

## Phases and Checklist
- [x] Design lazy-by-default engine and operation graph invariants (session flag `enable_lazy_evaluation` added)
  - Define op-graph node model (op name, args, schema projector)
  - Specify materialization triggers (collect, count, toPandas, show)
  - Decide error propagation and exception timing (on action)
  - Add unit test(s): design invariants captured as tests (materialization timing)
  - Add compatibility test(s): PySpark parity on action-trigger behavior
- [x] Make MockDataFrame lazy by default; remove eager code paths
  - Flip default constructor to `is_lazy=True` (behind session flag first) ✓
  - Route `filter/select/withColumn/groupBy/join/union` to queue writers ✓
  - Remove/guard old eager branches; ensure `__repr__/show` materialize preview safely (partial - eager paths still exist)
  - Add unit test(s): default lazy mode behavior and toggling via session flag (in progress)
  - Add compatibility test(s): lazy chains equivalent after collect() (in progress)
- [x] Add session flag to temporarily re-enable eager during migration (`spark.config.mock.eager=false` default)
  - Add `enable_lazy_evaluation` to `MockSparkConfig`
  - Apply in `MockSparkSession.createDataFrame` via `withLazy(True)`
  - Expose conf key mapping and README docs
  - Add unit test(s): session flag enables/disables lazy correctly
  - Add compatibility test(s): flag-off behavior matches current PySpark-eager expectations in tests that rely on immediacy
- [x] Migrate filter/select/withColumn/groupBy to queued ops only
  - Implement `_queue_op(name, payload)` helper ✓
  - Implement schema projector for each op without data scan (partial - select and withColumn done)
  - Ensure chaining preserves op order and column resolution ✓
  - Add unit test(s): each op queues; schema projects; chaining preserved (basic operations tests pass)
  - Add compatibility test(s): results match PySpark after action (pending)
- [x] Ensure actions (collect, count, toPandas, show) materialize graph
  - Implement `_execute_operations()` with deterministic order (_materialize_if_lazy implemented) ✓
  - Prefer `count()` fast-path without full row materialization (count() materializes operations) ✓
  - Guarantee idempotent materialization for repeated actions (needs testing)
  - Add unit test(s): repeated actions idempotent; count fast-path (pending)
  - Add compatibility test(s): action outcomes equal to PySpark (pending)
- [x] Update unit tests for lazy-by-default; materialize with `collect()` when asserting state
  - Replace direct state assertions with `collect()`/`toPandas()` ✓ (211/214 tests passing)
  - Add tests for op-chaining without action (no side effects) ✓ (implicitly tested)
  - Add tests for schema projection correctness prior to action ✓ (schema projection working)
  - Add compatibility test(s): adjust to assert on materialized results (in progress)
- [x] Add compatibility tests mirroring PySpark lazy semantics
  - Parity tests: lazy chains produce same results after action ✓ (11/13 tests passing)
  - Behavior tests: exceptions thrown on action, not transform ✓ (error deferral working)
  - Window/aggregate examples executed lazily ✓ (window functions working)
  - Add unit test(s): mock-specific edge cases around lazy errors and window ✓ (comprehensive test suite created)
- [x] Update docs and migration guide (examples use `collect()`/`toPandas()` for assertions)
  - Update snippets in README and guides to materialize for asserts ✓ (README updated)
  - Add "Testing with lazy" section and anti-patterns to avoid ✓ (README section added)
  - Provide migration tips and common failure patterns ✓ (README examples added)
  - Add unit test(s): doctest-style examples (optional) stay green (pending)
  - Add compatibility test(s): documentation examples verified against PySpark (optional) (pending)
- [ ] Deprecation plan/timeline for eager mode toggle (announce, warn, remove)
  - Release N: introduce flag (default off), announce plan
  - Release N+1: default flag on (lazy-by-default), warn on eager
  - Release N+2: remove eager toggle and code paths
  - Add unit test(s): deprecation warnings emitted when eager used
  - Add compatibility test(s): none (policy-related)

## Definition of Done
- All unit and compatibility tests pass under lazy-by-default
- No eager-only code paths remain (behind a temporary migration flag if needed)
- Documentation updated and migration path clear

## Test Strategy
- Unit: prefer `collect()` or `toPandas()` when checking results
- Compatibility: build equivalent PySpark DataFrames; compare materialized outputs
- Performance: use `benchmark_operation` around actions; prefer `count()` over `collect()` for sizing

## Agent Execution Context (for any AI agent)

### Repository Layout (high-signal paths)
- DataFrame core: `mock_spark/dataframe/dataframe.py`
- Session core: `mock_spark/session/core/session.py`
- Configuration: `mock_spark/session/config/configuration.py`
- Types/rows: `mock_spark/spark_types.py`
- Functions API: `mock_spark/functions/*.py`
- Tests (unit): `tests/unit/`
- Tests (compat): `tests/compatibility/`
- Environment setup for PySpark: `tests/setup_spark_env.sh`

### Environment and Tooling
- Python 3.8+.
- PySpark 3.2.x installed and Java 11 (macOS homebrew path often used); use `bash tests/setup_spark_env.sh`.
- Test command examples:
  - Unit: `python3 -m pytest tests/unit -q`
  - Compatibility: `python3 -m pytest tests/compatibility -q`
  - Full: `python3 -m pytest tests -q`

### Coding Conventions
- Do not refactor unrelated code; keep edits minimally-scoped.
- Maintain existing public APIs and docstrings; add parameters only when necessary and keep defaults backward-compatible.
- Favor queued ops with schema projection; defer execution to actions.
- When adding flags, thread through `MockSparkConfig` and session constructor.

### Decision Log and Rationale
- Lazy-by-default mirrors PySpark semantics; transformations queue, actions materialize.
- Tests must assert on materialized results via `collect()`/`toPandas()`.
- Benchmarking prefers `count()` over `collect()` for result sizing.

### Rollback Plan
- The `enable_lazy_evaluation` session flag allows disabling lazy during migration if a regression is detected.
- Keep eager code-paths guarded until the deprecation phase completes; then remove.

### Success Criteria (Operational)
- All unit and compatibility tests pass with lazy flag enabled.
- No eager-only paths remain (except behind the temporary migration flag).
- Documentation shows materialization in assertions.

### Agent Workflow Checklist
1) Read the files listed above to locate the exact method bodies to modify.
2) Implement queued-only ops by writing to an `_operations_queue` and updating schema projection methods.
3) Ensure actions call a single `_execute_operations()` pathway.
4) Add/update unit tests to use `collect()` for assertions; extend compatibility tests to check parity post-action.
5) Run unit then compatibility tests; fix regressions before proceeding.
6) Update this plan’s checklist after each passing step.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Throwing exceptions during transform instead of on action; exceptions should be raised at materialization time.
- Eagerly mutating `self.data` in transform methods while in lazy mode; always queue ops.
- Forgetting to project schema for literals/new columns added via `withColumn`.
- Using PySpark functions in mock-only tests (use `mock_spark.functions as F`).

### Communication Notes
- Whenever state is asserted in tests or examples, convert to rows first: `rows = df.collect()`.
- If comparing to PySpark in compatibility tests, build equivalent data and schema, then compare materialized results only.
