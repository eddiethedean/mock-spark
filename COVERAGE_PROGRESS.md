## 📊 Expected Coverage Results

Based on the comprehensive test suite created:

**Estimated Overall Coverage**: **80-90%**

This represents a **30-40% increase** from the baseline 50% coverage.

### Why Not 100%?
Some areas may still have gaps:
1. **Error edge cases**: Some exception paths may be hard to trigger
2. **Complex internal logic**: Deep storage backend internals
3. **Platform-specific code**: OS-dependent functionality
4. **Legacy/deprecated code**: Old APIs that aren't commonly used
5. **Mock implementations**: Some mock methods may be placeholder implementations

### Areas Likely at 90%+
- DataFrame operations
- Grouped operations
- Window functions
- Exception handling
- Functions (conditional, string, math)
- SQL validation

### Areas Likely at 75-85%
- Storage backends (file operations, edge cases)
- Data generation (distribution algorithms)
- Performance simulation (advanced metrics)
- RDD operations (advanced transformations)
- Lazy evaluation (optimizer internals)

### Areas Likely at 60-75%
- Testing utilities (factory internals)
- Serialization (format edge cases)
- Session management (config edge cases)

## 🔄 Next Steps for 100% Coverage

1. **Run Full Coverage Report**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ --cov=mock_spark --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

2. **Identify Remaining Gaps**
   - Review HTML coverage report
   - Focus on red/yellow areas
   - Prioritize by module importance

3. **Create Targeted Tests**
   - Add tests for specific uncovered lines
   - Focus on edge cases and error paths
   - Add integration tests for complex interactions

4. **Fix Test Failures**
   - Some tests may expose real implementation gaps
   - Fix failing tests or adjust expectations
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Add stress tests for large datasets
   - Test memory management
   - Validate performance metrics

## 📝 Test Examples

### Unit Test Example
```python
def test_window_partition_by(spark):
    \"\"\"Test window partitioning.\"\"\"
    data = [{"category": "A", "value": 10}]
    df = spark.createDataFrame(data)
    
    window_spec = Window.partitionBy("category")
    result = df.withColumn("sum", F.sum("value").over(window_spec))
    assert result.count() == 1
```

### Integration Test Example
```python
def test_dataframe_with_functions_and_storage(spark):
    \"\"\"Test DataFrame operations with functions persist correctly.\"\"\"
    df = spark.createDataFrame([{"name": "alice", "age": 25}])
    result = df.withColumn("name_upper", F.upper(F.col("name")))
    rows = result.collect()
    assert rows[0]["name_upper"] == "ALICE"
```

### System Test Example
```python
def test_ecommerce_analytics_workflow(spark):
    \"\"\"Test complete e-commerce analytics workflow.\"\"\"
    orders = spark.createDataFrame([...])
    customers = spark.createDataFrame([...])
    
    result = orders.join(customers, "customer_id")
                  .groupBy("segment")
                  .agg(F.sum("amount").alias("revenue"))
    assert result.count() > 0
```
