## Recommendations

### For Development
```bash
bash tests/run_fast_tests.sh  # ~20 seconds, Python 3.8
```

### For Full Validation
```bash
bash tests/run_all_tests.sh   # ~1m 40s, Python 3.8
```

### For Coverage Reports
```bash
python3.8 -m pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/ tests/documentation/ \
    --cov=mock_spark --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Next Steps

### To Fix Remaining Failures

1. **Fix SQL Parser** (High Priority)
   - String functions (upper, lower, substring)
   - Boolean expressions in CASE WHEN
   - Complex SQL constructs
   - Impact: Would fix 15+ tests

2. **Implement Missing Features** (Medium Priority)
   - Pivot.sum() method
   - Column subscript operator
   - Global temp view namespace
   - Impact: Would fix 5+ tests

3. **Fix Type Conversions** (Low Priority)
   - Boolean to numeric
   - String literal handling
   - Impact: Would fix 2-3 tests

4. **Fix Package Issues** (Documentation)
   - Add sqlmodel to dependencies
   - Fix example imports
   - Impact: Would fix 2 tests

### To Increase Coverage to 60%+

1. Add more DataFrame method tests
2. Test materializer edge cases
3. Add storage backend tests
4. Test more function combinations
5. Fix SQL bugs to unskip 30 tests
